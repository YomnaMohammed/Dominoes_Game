# Dominoes_Game
The Dominoes Game Solver is a Prolog program designed to tackle the Dominoes puzzle using two distinct search methods: uninformed search (BFS) and informed search (greedy best-first). The main goal is to find a valid arrangement of dominoes on a rectangular board while adhering to specific conditions and maximizing the number of dominoes placed. To enhance user interaction and experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed using Python.

Uninformed Search:

The uninformed search technique relies on a breadth-first search algorithm to systematically explore all potential domino placements on the puzzle board. This process continues until a valid solution is found or all possible configurations have been examined.

Informed Search:

In contrast, the informed search technique utilizes a greedy best-first search algorithm. This approach aims to determine the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the puzzle board. It evaluates the available moves based on a heuristic function, allowing the algorithm to prioritize the most promising options.

GUI:

To provide a user-friendly experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been implemented using Python. Through this interface, users can interactively input the size of the board and observe the solutions generated by the Prolog program.

Game Rules:

1. The game board is represented as a rectangular grid with dimensions M x N.
2. Each domino piece occupies 2 x 1 cells on the board.
3. There are two bomb cells marked as 'X,' each occupying a single 1 x 1 square.
4. The primary objective is to position the dominoes on the board, ensuring that each domino covers exactly two squares, without overlapping or extending beyond the board boundaries.
5. Dominoes can be rotated to different orientations during the placement process.
